  <p>I am currently learning to code with
    <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code For Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
  internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
  Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
  </p>
<ol>
  <li>You can understand what is going on "under the hood"</li>
  <li>Not have to rely on someone else for a quick prototype website!</li>
  <li>It's fun!</li>
</ol>
  <h2>What do you need to creat a website?</h2>

  <p>Not much!
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Acomputer (always a good start)</li>
    <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
    <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
    <li>Some HTML,CSS and JS files</li>
  </ul>
